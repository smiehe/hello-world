Hello Humans,

the interdisciplinary RuralFutures research project funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) takes place during the period 2014 to 2018 with funding amount of EUR 2 million.

The project focuses on the land-use change of the South American native grasslands. RuralFutures works together with German and Uruguayan research institutes, government and non-government organisations, as well with national and transnational forestry and agriculture companies. The objective of the project is to develop multifunctional, biodiverse and sustainable productive land-use concepts.

Thank you for reading,
